## Internal Team Meeting Notes
Our team discussed the peer review feedback and general class feedback. We plan to incorporate some ideas during both the alpha and beta checkpoints. 

Our key Alpha coding tasks of focus include: 
1. Organization heirarchy input - how can we make this simple for admins to add users + roles? 
2. Ensure login feature works + front end aesthetics 
3. General UI cohesiveness 
4. Feedback form - refine + add custom components per role
