## User Journey 

Senior developer Mary recently shifted to a new team at her company. She mentions to Sam, who is responsible for coordinating HR tasks, that progress has been slow. She is unfamiliar with her teammates' working habits and struggles making progress and decisions due to ineffective communication. Her team is relatively large, consisting of 20 people. 

Sam utilizes **360Feedback** to help Mary's team work more effectively. Sam begins by uploading the team hierarchy into the system, and using the application's standard team engagement questionaire as well as adding custom questions related to Mary's specific concerns such as working habits. Sam then proceeds to send the form to everyone in the team, and they are given a time frame of 1 week to complete the feedback form, which contains varying contents depending on the team member's role in the team.

A week later, Sam receives 15 responses, and uses these responses to generate a generalized report, which details and summarizes how people in the team feel about the existing dynamic, areas they wish to improve, detailed problems they experience, and more. It contains summary statistics and charts for quick understanding, as well as more detailed written feedback, which has been synthesized and combined effectively by 360Feedback. 

Sam sends this report to Mary's team, allowing them to gain a hollistic view of the feedback and discuss changes and next steps.
