# 6.104 Team 3Dev Final Reflections 

## Diego Peon 
Working on our 360-degree HR feedback app was a great learning experience, not just technically in developing with Vue or MongoDB but also tackling a larger project with concept design. The longer planning phase that included the public pitch and iterating based on feedback was also novel and helpful in being more akin to an experience in industry. By virtue of our web app's functionality, we also had to think about some interesting problems regarding handling user data in a real implementation situation which is something I think is learned best in practice than in class. 

My personal project from earlier in the class was a music stats and recommendations web app and so its interesting problems mostly taught me about using external APIs. In contrast, our app's data structure is much more sophisticated in how it had to be organized into concepts. This brought us some headaches and led to reworking concepts and syncs as we explained above, but in the end I think it bought me more into the idea of concept design.

Throughout the development of our 360 degree HR feedback application, I was able to both reinforce skills from my previous matcha tracker personal project and significantly expand my technical and collaborative experience in a team-based web development environment. Moving from an individual project to a multi-developer application highlighted the differences in scale and design thinking required at each level of software development.

My matcha tracker personal project had primarily focused on personal data management and visualization, which helped me build a strong foundation in Vue.js, state management, and creating intuitive user interfaces tailored to a single user's needs. In contrast, developing the HR feedback application required a fundamental shift in perspective for me since we had to design for many concurrent users and manage sensitive employee data, as well as support structured organizational workflows rather than simple personal tracking. This pushed me to think more critically about application architecture and security considerations.

A major learning outcome was breaking down complex business logic like role-based access and review aggregation into reusable and testable components that could interact reliably across the system. On the frontend, I deepened my understanding of Vue.js by working with more advanced component patterns and shared state across views. I also gained practical experience implementing animations and interactive elements in a way that enhanced usability without compromising clarity or performance. On the backend, I strengthened my ability to separate concerns into defined concepts and layers, ensuring that data handling and logic remained cleanly decoupled. This reinforced best practices around scalability and maintainability that were less critical, but still relatively important, in my earlier solo project. Working on this app helped me grow as a developer and as a collaborator, ultimately making me more adaptable and effective in a real world software development setting.

I enjoyed learning, building, refining our project, and the experience taught me both technical and collaborative lessons.

- Improved technical skills
  - Designed and implemented features from the concepts perspective and worked on making concepts interact with each other
  - *Worked on front-end design and had to actively think about how features could displayed to minimize user frictions, maximize functionality, but also keeping feasibility in mind*
  - Worked with our database stack

- Testing and quality
  - Improved debugging and logging techniques to diagnose production issues
    - Frequently we had bugs on the deployed site that were not present when running locally, so we all had to be careful and actively check the render logs. This was am interesting learning experience. 

- Collaboration and workflow
  - Practiced feature branching, code review, and clear commit messages to keep the repo healthy
  - Learned to break large problems into smaller tasks and coordinate across teammates

- Project and time management
  - Estimated work more accurately after tracking effort and iterating on scope
  - Prioritized deliverables

Overall, the project deepened my software development skills, especially related to using AI to increase productivity and develop more complex features, made me a more reliable collaborator, and reinforced the value of testing, clear communication, and incremental delivery.
