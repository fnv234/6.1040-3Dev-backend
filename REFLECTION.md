I enjoyed learning, building, refining our project, and the experience taught me both technical and collaborative lessons.

- Improved technical skills
  - Designed and implemented features from the concepts perspective and worked on making concepts interact with each other
  - *Worked on front-end design and had to actively think about how features could displayed to minimize user frictions, maximize functionality, but also keeping feasibility in mind*
  - Worked with our database stack

- Testing and quality
  - Improved debugging and logging techniques to diagnose production issues
    - Frequently we had bugs on the deployed site that were not present when running locally, so we all had to be careful and actively check the render logs. This was am interesting learning experience. 

- Collaboration and workflow
  - Practiced feature branching, code review, and clear commit messages to keep the repo healthy
  - Learned to break large problems into smaller tasks and coordinate across teammates

- Project and time management
  - Estimated work more accurately after tracking effort and iterating on scope
  - Prioritized deliverables

Overall, the project deepened my software development skills, especially related to using AI to increase productivity and develop more complex features, made me a more reliable collaborator, and reinforced the value of testing, clear communication, and incremental delivery.
